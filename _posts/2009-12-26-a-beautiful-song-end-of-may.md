Close your eyes and roll a dice

Under the board there's a compromise

If after all we only live twice

Which life is the run road to paradise

Don't say a word

Here comes the break of the day

In white clouds of sand raised

by the wind of the end of May

Close your eyes and make a bet

Faced to the glare of the sunset

This is about as far as we get

You haven't seen me disguised yet

Don't say a word

Here comes the break of the day

In white clouds of sand raised

by the wind of the end of May

Close your eyes and make a wish

Under the stone there's a stone-fish

Hold your breath, then roll the dice

It might be the run road to paradise

Don't say a word

Here comes the break of the day

In white clouds of sand raised

by the wind of the end

Don't say a word

Here comes the break of the day

In white clouds of sand raised

by the wind of the end of May

五月末梢 凯伦&middot;安

闭上双眼，甩个骰子

悄声地，做个让步

如果有来生

哪次生命，可以通往天堂

什么也不要说

黎明破晓

五月的尽头

风吹起白色的沙子

闭上双眼，下个赌注

面对耀眼的落日

那是我们最远的天涯

在你面前我没有伪装

什么也不要说

黎明破晓

五月的尽头

风吹起白色的沙子

闭上双眼，许个心愿

在石头下，有巨毒的石鱼

屏住呼吸，甩个骰子

这也许是一条通往天堂的路

什么也不要说

黎明破晓

五月的尽头

风吹起白色的沙子

什么也不要说

黎明破晓

五月的尽头

风吹起白色的
