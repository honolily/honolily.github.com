[![yuanli info image](/assets/img/2012/11/egg.jpg)](/assets/img/2012/11/egg.jpg)Until recently it was thought that eggs are not so good for human organism, but eggs have twice as much antioxidant properties then apples, say experts.

直到最近，人们都还是认为鸡蛋对人体不太好，但是目前专家却说，鸡蛋含有两倍于苹果的抗氧化剂！

Eggs are an excellent source of protein, lipids, vitamins and minerals, and contain antioxidants that help prevent cardiovascular disease and cancer.

鸡蛋是极好的蛋白质、脂肪、维他命、矿物质等生命必需元素的来源，而且富含抗氧化剂，起到预防心血管疾病和癌症的作用！

This is especially true for eggs from chickens fed with wheat and corn. Egg yolks contain two amino acids, tryptophan and tyrosine, which have excellent properties for the preservation of cells in the human body.

最有营养的鸡蛋莫过于喂养小麦和玉米的鸡所生的蛋了。这种鸡蛋的蛋黄含有两种氨基酸类物质：色氨酸和酪氨酸，这两种氨基酸能够延长细胞的存活时间。

Scientists have confirmed that the two egg yolks in their raw state have nearly twice the antioxidant properties then apples and about the same as 25 grams of cranberries.

科学家证实，两只这种生鸡蛋的蛋黄所含有的抗氧化物质几乎是苹果的两倍，等同于一个25克的越蔓橘所含的抗氧化成分。

However, when the eggs are fried or boiled, antioxidant properties have been reduced by about half, and slightly more if you use microwave.

然而，经过蒸煮煎炸之后，抗氧化物质就减少了接近一半，如果你用微波炉加工的话，那就消耗殆尽啦！

While this is a great reduction of properties, two eggs still have the same antioxidant properties as well as an average size apple.

既然烹饪之后的鸡蛋抗氧化物质减少了一半，那么每天两只鸡蛋所含有的抗氧化成分还是相当于一只普通苹果的！

放心食用吧！
