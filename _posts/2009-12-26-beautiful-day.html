<p>It&nbsp;&nbsp; can't be a beautiful day today. It's cloudy and I felt lonely even though I called some of&nbsp; my friends. The moment I cut my phone , I got loneliness.&nbsp; But I like this feeling, cause it made me feel different and alive.&nbsp; I am considering where my life&nbsp; direction will be, the more books I read and great movies&nbsp; I watched, the more confuse I get. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-829"></a></p>
<p>But today I came across the song " End of May" . It's such a naive and fresh song, that even from the prelude I fell in love with it. And then the depressed&nbsp; feeling that I was taken just&nbsp; now has gone. I felt pleasure.</p>
<p>It told us a girl who is day dreaming by herself, maybe in a very beautiful late May day. May is always consider to be the peotic month. I like May, it's the month between spring and summer, it's a most dreamingful month. I used to make a lot of poems by myself&nbsp; during&nbsp; high school days. Among those&nbsp; poems , I sensed the outstanding life in my dream. I encouraged myself with them. Because then I was a girl who&nbsp; moaning for the lacking love from parents and struggling for the unknow&nbsp; future, yet nobody told me where I should go.&nbsp; And it ailed&nbsp; me to handle the problem of emotion. Adolescence seems to be a trouble age , and endless.&nbsp; Yet, I am afraid it will gone too fast before I can enjoy everything.&nbsp; It's pity that the ripe peach shall be rotten before someone taste it.</p>
<p>Yes, I have gone through that confusing high school days. I always thought that if I could have a wiser friend I shall enjoy a more lovely high school days. Maybe I shall be a poet now. Just kidding. I know that some of my dreams have gone rotten like the summer peaches.</p>
<p>What if I have those dream all come true?&nbsp; Will I be much happier and wiser?&nbsp; Will I get a better life?&nbsp; Now I am still goofing around, taking some job that won't make me rich and no social insurance. There will come to a day that I sick and die alone on my own bed. That's life, my life.&nbsp; I have dreamt too much, and here is the price.</p>
<p>I found this song so soft and indulgeable, that I can listen to it again and again, until die. I have nothing more to ask for, no regret.&nbsp; What I really want from life is a beautiful mood. If I shall die tomorrow, I hope to die peacefully and cotentedly.</p>
